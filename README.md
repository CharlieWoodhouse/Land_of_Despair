# Land_of_Despair(first_game_created)
Land of Despair is a 2D game developed in C# using Visual Studio 2022 and the Monogame extension. This top-down shooter game challenges players to survive waves of zombies, collect valuable items, and achieve high scores as they progress through rounds.

The full PDF can be sent if requested, but here is some of the basic documentation that went into the game:
> ### Panning

Score based performance allows players to receive a score to improve on, allowing for competition, leading into increasing difficulty in levels to show off skill, to see how far you as a player can go. Collectables and enemies should allow for strategy and challenges to the player, allowing players navigate carefully, furthermore having an interface being user friendly, will make it easy for the player to understand and be able to focus on the gameplay. The deadline set to complete all stages of game development is 11 weeks.


> ### Game Design

My game design centres around surviving waves of zombies while gathering valuable items like gold, silver, and gems to accumulate points. You can also earn points by eliminating zombies. As the rounds progress, the number of zombies intensifies, making higher rounds more challenging to endure. This demands skill to reach higher levels. Losing a life occurs when a zombie hits you, and players start with 3 lives. Once all 3 lives are depleted, it's game over. 

**Key Features:**
- Top-down perspective gameplay
- Increasingly challenging rounds of zombies
- WASD keys for movement
- Mouse aiming for the space gun
- Scoring system based on zombie elimination and item collection
- Three lives per game


**The aim**
Is to see how long you can survive for, due to it being a round based game, meaning you can gain points and survive rounds to reach a high score.


**Scoring**

| Gem       | 75             |
| Zombie    | 100            |


**Rounds**

|------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
| Health     |150|250|350|450|550|650|750|850|950|1050|

|------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
|Spawn Delay |150|250|350|450|550|650|750|850|950|1050|

|------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|
|Zombie Count| 6 | 8 | 10| 12| 14| 16| 18| 20| 22| 24 |

> ### Review and Future Improvements

While Land of Despair is a great starting point, there are opportunities for future enhancements, such as adding power-ups, more objective sprites, additional weapons, and a retry option on the game over screen. Given the constraints of an 11-week development timeframe, I believe the game has achieved its goals effectively.
